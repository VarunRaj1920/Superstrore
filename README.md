# Superstrore
A superstore wants to predict the likelihood of the customer giving a positive response and wants to identify the different factors which affect the customer's response. We need to analyse the data provided to identify the factors and then build a prediction model to predict the probability of a customer will give a positive response. Here is a summary of the tasks implemented:

1️⃣ I have analysed the data set through 8 machine learning models which include :
1. Logistic Regression
2. SVC
3. KNN
4. Gaussian Naive Bayes
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest
7. Passive Aggressive
8. Gradient Boosting Machine
Out of these , Gradient Boosting Machine yielded the maximum accuracy.

2️⃣ I have done the pre-processing in two steps, 1st for categorical features and 2nd for numerical features.

3️⃣ I have tried to modify the correlation heatmap and given it a different form all together. Instead if boxes circles have been used to represent the values and size of circle depends on the value.

4️⃣ Gradient Boosting Machine Algorithm has been used further and parameters such as F-1 Score ,Precision Score, Recall Score , Jaccard Score and Log Loss have been evaluated.
